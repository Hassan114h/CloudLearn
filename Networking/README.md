## :zap: Launching an NGINX Web Server on an Amazon EC2 :cloud:

I will be highlighting the steps to launch an NGINX web server on an Amazon EC2 instance :cloud:, and map it to a domain purchased through Cloudflare.

## ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Purchase a Domain on Cloudflare

This should cost around $5 - $10

## ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Launch an EC2 Instance
- AMI: Amazon Linux 2023
- Instance Type: t3.micro
- Security Group Inbound Rules:
  - Port 22 (SSH) â€“ Your IP
  - Port 80 (HTTP) â€“ 0.0.0.0/0
  - Port 443 (HTTPS) â€“ 0.0.0.0/0

## ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Note the Public IPv4 Address

After launching, locate the **Public IPv4 address** in the **EC2 instance summary**.  
ðŸ“Œ You'll use this later to point your domain to the server.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Connect to the EC2 Instance via SSH

Run this command in your terminal:

ssh -i /path/to/key.pem ec2-user@<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>

## 5) Install NGINX
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install -y nginx
sudo systemctl start nginx
sudo systemctl enable nginx

## 6) Login to your Cloudfare account, and create an A record for your domain. Point this to the Public IPV4 address you noted down earlier.

## 7) Go back onto the terminal, and confirm propagation.

nslookup (Your domain).
After a few minutes, the result should show the public IPV4 address, with your domain:

## 8) Customise your page with the command

sudo yum install nginx -y sudo systemctl start nginx

## 9) Finally, search your domain on your browser and you should find your website. :clap:

#ðŸŽ‰ You now have an NGINX web server running on EC2, mapped to your custom domain!
