# Notes 

## Intro to Networking 
Computer Network = Devices connected to each other to share resources. Enables communication between devices. 

LAN = Small and covers a limited network, e.g Home wifi. It allows devices to communicate with one another. 

WAN = Large, connects everyone world wide, e.g Internet.

## Switches, Routers and firewalls 

Switches = Connects devices within the same network, using Ethernet Cables. Manages dataflow within a LAN.

Router = Direct traffic between networks. Also, connects different networks, for e,g your home network with the internet. 

Firewalls = Protects from unauthorised access. Also, it monitors and controls incoming and outgoing traffic. 

## Ip Address

Ip address = Unique identifiers for devices. IPV4  and IPV 6 (longer). They enable devices to identify and communicate with each other on the network.

Mac address = Unique Idenfitifier assigned to a network device. (Laptop, Smartphone) Without them devices, wouldn't be able to communicate with their local network. When your router or switch wants to send information to a specific device (like your phone), it uses the MAC address to know exactly where to send it.
